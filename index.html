							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>My name is Christopher Rivera.  I started off taking college courses towards a computer engineering student. 
								However, like most people it 
								as time/ money consuming.  I dabled with coding in the past but felt like I coul not do it.
								I took a Intro to Java class and fell in love from System.out.println("Hello World!").  But i wanted a faster way to achieve my goals.  
								With much time consuming research I found and chose Lambda School.  It has been an incredible experience. I have learned so much and cannot wait to learn so much more.
								Thats one perk of this career change, constantly learning.  It is never boring and full of challenges and great rewards when achieved. I cannot wait to see
								where this brings me and my family in the future. Thank you!

							<h2>Career Goals!</h2>
							<p>I have a wude range of passed job experiences that have taught me so much.  I have worked in the food business, retail, hospitals, rehab/recovery, but i was never satisfied.
								I pursued a yoga certificate and now teach yoga which I thoroughly enjoy.  I wanted something long term.  I found coding. 
								My ultimate goal is to be able to create websites, apps, even games to promit fitness, health and wellbeing.  Of course, I can not wait
								to learn the aspects of different areas.  The more I can learn the better in the long run.  I wish to help and change lives in a meaningful way with my coding.
								Even if it is just from behind a computer screen.
